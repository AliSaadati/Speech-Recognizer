For CS 582, Intro to Speech Processing with Professor Courtney Konopk at San Diego City College

The purpose of this project is to create a system which recognizes a users voice and allows the user to use their voice as a 'password'.
The system will consist of a training algorithm which takes samples of the users voice and learns their speech patterns and a 
detection algorithm which uses learned speech patterns to decide whether a given sample corresponds with the users voice.

As of the planning phase, most of the learning and detecting algorithms are to be done using MATLAB. Any GUI for the project is likely
to be done using Java.
